      <br><p>In gratitude, the leper directed Don Juan to an old hermit who could help him. The hermit provided him with crucial advice and tools: a razor to cut his palm, seven limes to keep himself awake, and a golden rope to capture the bird. </p>

Only Don Juan ventured down, where he discovered two captive princesses: one guarded by a giant and the other by a seven-headed serpent. Don Juan defeated both monsters, rescuing the princesses. However, when he returned to retrieve Princess Leonora's ring, Don Pedro maliciously cut the rope, leaving Don Juan to fall into the depths of the well.</p>
