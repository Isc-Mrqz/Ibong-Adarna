      <br><p>In gratitude, the leper directed Don Juan to an old hermit who could help him. The hermit provided him with crucial advice and tools: a bucket of water, a razor to cut his palm, seven limes to keep himself awake, and a golden rope to capture the bird. </p>

However, an old man found and rescued Don Juan, allowing him to return to the kingdom.</p>
    <br><p>The Ibong Adarna, which had refused to sing until then, sang seven enchanting songs, healing King Fernando. </p>
    <br><p>As a punishment, Don Pedro and Don Diego are supposedly killed, but Don Juan forgave them, and pleaded to his father not to, which because of that King Fernando, took it into consideration and instead tasked them to take care of the bird. </p>
    <br><p>However, despite all of this, Don Pedro and Don Diego planned to frame Don Juan. Once Don Juan was asleep and it was his turn to guard the Ibong Adarna, his two elder brothers released the Ibong Adarna from its cage, causing its disappearance. Wrongly accused, Don Juan left Berbanya in silence, choosing exile over confrontation.</p>

However, the ruler in this kingdom, King Salermo, was very angry and disproved of their relationship. So he gave Don Juan seven trials to prove his worth and earn Princess Maria's hand in marriage.

  <!-- This container details the seven trials given by the King to Don Juan. -->
  <div class="main-chapter-1-container">
    <p>The first trial was <strong>The Tree of Gold</strong>, where Don Juan was tasked with planting a tree that would grow, bloom, and bear fruit overnight. Knowing the task was beyond human ability, Princess Maria secretly used her magic to make the tree flourish, and by morning, it stood tall and golden.</p>
    <br><p>Next, King Salermo demanded <strong>The Palace of Gold</strong> — a magnificent palace that had to be built before dawn. Once again, Princess Maria used her powers, and by sunrise, a splendid golden palace shimmered in the light, leaving the king in awe.</p>
    <br><p>The third trial was <strong>The Gold River </strong>. Don Juan was ordered to fetch water from a golden river hidden deep within the kingdom. With Princess Maria's guidance and magic, he successfully located the river and brought back its radiant water in a golden flask.</p>
    <br><p>The fourth trial, <strong>The Sunken Treasure</strong>, required Don Juan to retrieve a ring that the king threw into the sea. Princess Maria transformed herself into a fish and dove into the ocean to recover the ring, which she then gave to Don Juan to present to the king.</p>
    <br><p>The fifth challenge involved <strong>The Glass Jar</strong>. Don Juan was asked to fill the jar with water from a magical spring, a task the king believed to be impossible. However, with Princess Maria’s enchanted jar, the water was collected and presented to the king.</p>
    <br><p>For the sixth trial, King Salermo commanded Don Juan to tame <strong>The Kingdom’s Horses</strong>. These wild and untamable creatures roamed across the vast plains of the kingdom. Princess Maria gave Don Juan a magical whip and bridle, allowing him to gather the horses with ease and return them to the king.</p>
    <br><p>The final trial was the most dangerous: <strong>The Den of Serpents</strong>. King Salermo ordered Don Juan to spend the night in a room filled with venomous snakes and deadly scorpions. Unfazed, Princess Maria cast a protective spell over Don Juan, ensuring that no harm would come to him. By morning, he emerged unharmed, astonishing everyone.</p>
    <br><p>With the trials complete, Don Juan proved his worth and the strength of his love for Princess Maria. Though King Salermo was furious, he could no longer deny their union. However, his wrath was not entirely spent, and the couple’s challenges were far from over.</p>
